# CV

https://hawkirk.com/cv

Resume rewritten in html to allow more control. Template taken from [clemente.io](https://clemente.io).

Uses `yarn` for package management.

Use `yarn install` to install packages, `yarn run build` to compile the css and generate the pdf, or `yarn sass` to just generate the css.

The pdf of the site is generated using the `phantomjs`, a headless webkit browser. It is installed and ran in a docker container.
